Ad-hoc commands, Modules & Playbook:

Ad-hoc Commands are those linux commands which does not have no ideampotency which means that it does the same task repetatively.
These are commands which can be run individually to perform quick functions.
These ad-hoc commands are are not use for configuration management and deployment because these commands are only for one time usage.
The ansible ad-hoc commands uses the /usr/bin/ansible command line tool to automate a single task.

$ ansible groupname(demo) -a "ls"

if we want to see all the files in all the nodes then run: asible all -a "ls"
To create a file in 1000s of nodes we can run the command: ansible all -a "touch filename(ABC)"
To list all details of a group run: ansible demo(group name) -a "la -al"

To install/remove the packages in all the nodes through server run : ansible demo -a "sudo yum install httpd -y" / ansible demo -a "yum remove httpd -y"

To check the package in any of the node run: which package name(httpd)

#Modules: 
It is a single command which executes one at a time.

Ansible ships with number of modules (called module library) that can be executed diectly on the remote hosts through "playbook"
Module library resides on any machines and there are no servers, daemins or database required.
The default location for the inventory file is /etc/ansible/hosts

[ansible@ip]$ ansible demo -b -m yum -a "pkg= httpd state=present"


Present= install
Absent=remove
Latest=update
Started=to start the service
sudo service httpd status- to check the status of the service.


module name will preceed -m (module name) service.

Create user: ansible demo -b -m user -a "name=raj"
To check the user: cat /etc/passwd



DEMO:
[ansible@ip-172-31-35-13 ~]$ ansible demo -b -m yum -a "pkg=httpd state=present"
[ansible@ip-172-31-35-13 ~]$ ansible demo -b -m service -a "name=httpd state=started"

To Copy a file or folder in one or more nodes from source to destination: ansible demo[-1] -b -m copy -a "src=copiedfromserver dest=/tmp"

Setup is a module which holds the information of all the installed packages.

Playbook: It is a combination of modules with miltiple commands which executes the file all at once.
