Ad-hoc commands, Modules & Playbook:

Ad-hoc Commands are those linux commands which does not have no ideampotency which means that it does the same task repetatively.
These are commands which can be run individually to perform quick functions.
These ad-hoc commands are are not use for configuration management and deployment because these commands are only for one time usage.
The ansible ad-hoc commands uses the /usr/bin/ansible command line tool to automate a single task.

$ ansible groupname(demo) -a "ls"

if we want to see all the files in all the nodes then run: asible all -a "ls"
To create a file in 1000s of nodes we can run the command: ansible all -a "touch filename(ABC)"
To list all details of a group run: ansible demo(group name) -a "la -al"

To install the packages in all the nodes through server run : ansible demo -a "sudo yum install httpd -y"




Modules: It is a single command which esecutes one at a time.



Playbook: It is a combination of modules with miltiple commands which executes the file all at once.
