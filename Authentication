Creating Keys (public & Private)/ Trust Relationship(between root - root & user - user).

Now go to ansible server and create key. Run the below command.

[ansible@ip] $ ssh-keygen
ls -a
.ssh (this file will be displayed)

go to .ssh file (cd .ssh/)

ls

2 keys will be displayed.
ex: id_rsa    id_rsa_pub

Now copy the public key in both the nodes.

ssh-copy-id user@node ip.

Ex:  ssh-copy-id ansible@172.31.44.53
