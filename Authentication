Creating Keys (public & Private)/ Trust Relationship(between root - root & user - user).

Now go to ansible server and create key. Run the below command.

[ansible@ip] $ ssh-keygen
ls -a
.ssh (this file will be displayed)

go to .ssh file (cd .ssh/)

ls

2 keys will be displayed.
ex: id_rsa    id_rsa_pub

Now copy the public key in both the nodes.

ssh-copy-id user@node ip.

Ex:  ssh-copy-id ansible@172.31.44.53


Host Patterns:
-------------
"All" pattern represents all the machines in the host.

ansible all --list-host

ansible <groupname>[0] --list-host

<groupname>[0] - picks first machine of the group.

<groupname>[1] - picks second machine of the group.

and so on in 0, 1, 2, 3.......-1 format.

<groupname>[0:7] - picks 1 to 7 machines in the group.

If we have multiple groups use : to pick the machines in the group.

group1:group2
ex: demo[2:5]: devops[4:8]
