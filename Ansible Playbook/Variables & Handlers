Variables:
---------
Ansible uses variables which are defined previously to enable more flexibility in playbook and roles.
They can be used to loop through a set of given values, access various information like the host name of a system and replace certain strings in templates with specific values.

ALway write variable section above task section so that it can be used later.

File: vars.yml

--- # My Variable Playbook
- hosts: demo
  user: ansible
  become: yes
  connection: yes
  vars:
     pkgname: httpd
  tasks:
   - name: install httpd on linux server
     action: yum name='{{pkgname}}' state=installed
     
     
Handlers Playbook:
------------------
A handler is exactly the same as as task, but it will run when called by another task.


OR

Handlers are just like regular tasks in an ansible playbook, but are only run if the task contains a notify directive and also indicates that it changed something.


[ansible@ip-172-31-35-13 ~]$ ansible-playbook handler.yml 
--- # My Handler Playbook
- hosts: demo
  user: ansible
become: yes
  connection: ssh
  tasks:
    - name: install httpd on linux server
action: yum name=httpd state=installed
notify: restart httpd
  handlers:
    - name: restart httpd
action: service name=httpd state=restarted




DRYRUN Check:
------------
Checks whether the playbook is formatted correctly.

ansible-playbook handler.yml --check
