Variables:
---------
Ansible uses variables which are defined previously to enable more flexibility in playbook and roles.
They can be used to loop through a set of given values, access various information like the host name of a system and replace certain strings in templates with specific values.

ALway write variable section above task section so that it can be used later.

File: vars.yml

--- # My Variable Playbook
- hosts: demo
  user: ansible
  become: yes
  connection: yes
  vars:
     pkgname: httpd
  tasks:
   - name: install httpd on linux server
     action: yum name='{{pkgname}}' state=installed
     
     
Handlers Playbook:
