Variables:
---------
Ansible uses variables which are defined previously to enable more flexibility in playbook and roles.
They can be used to loop through a set of given values, access various information like the host name of a system and replace certain strings in templates with specific values.

ALway write variable section above task section so that it can be used later.

File: vars.yml

  vars:
