Ansible Playbook:
----------------
It is a combination of modules with miltiple commands which executes the file all at once.

Playbook in ansible are written in YAML format.
It is human readable readable data serilization language.
It is like a file where we write codes which consists of var, tasks, handlesrs, files, templates and roles.

Each playbook is composed of one or more modules in a list. MOdules is a colleaction of configuration files.

Playbook are divided into many sections like: 
1. Target Section: Defines the host against which playbook task has to be executed.


2. Variables Section: Define variables.

3. Task Section: List of all modules that we need to run in an order.



YAML: Yet Another Markup Language:
----------------------------------

For ansible, nearly every YAML files starts with a list.
Each item in the list is a list of key-value pairs commonly knows as dictionary.


All YAML files have to begin with "---" and ends with "...".
All members of a list lines must begin with same indentation level starting with "-"

Ex: 
  --- # My Target Playbook
  - hosts: demo(group name)
    user: ansible
    decome: yes
    connection: ssh
    gather-facts: yes
    
    
Run the file: ansible-playbook target.yml
